# Web3 Data Pipelines Portfolio 🚀

**John Liu** – Senior Data Engineer (10+ years ETL/ELT: SSIS → Azure Data Factory, PostgreSQL, Python, SQL)  
Actively transitioning into full-time remote Web3 / Blockchain data engineering.

This repo showcases production-ready Web3 data projects I built in November 2025.  
Everything here is real, runnable, and directly proves I can do exactly what Web3 teams desperately need: reliably pull, clean, transform and visualize on-chain data.

## Live Projects

### 1. John Liu On-Chain Analytics Dashboard (Dune Analytics)

- Daily trading volume & fees (Uniswap V3 all pools)
- Top 20 pools breakdown
- Aave V3 total value locked + borrows
- USDT/USDC transfer volume (last 30 days)

Coming next week → USDT & USDC transfers indexed on Ethereum Mainnet  
Folder: `./the-graph-erc20-subgraph`

### 4. dbt Models on Flipside Crypto (Bitcoin + Ethereum metrics)  
Planned → Clean fact/dim models for daily active addresses, fees, whale movements  
Folder: `./dbt-flipside-bitcoin-ethereum`

## Why Web3 Teams Should Hire Me Right Now
Most Web3 data engineers are self-taught 22-year-olds with 1 year of experience.  
I bring 10+ years of battle-tested ETL/ELT experience from regulated environments (health research + compliance SaaS) — I will never break your production pipelines.
