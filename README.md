# Web3 Data Pipelines Portfolio 🚀

Senior Data Engineer (10+ years ETL/ELT with SSIS, Azure Data Factory, PostgreSQL, Python) actively transitioning into Web3 / Blockchain data engineering.

This repo contains real, production-grade Web3 data projects I built in Q4 2025 to demonstrate on-chain data skills that directly transfer from traditional data engineering.

## Projects (all runnable in < 5 minutes)

### 1. Uniswap V3 Daily Volume & Fees Dashboard (Dune Analytics v2)
- Full SQL queries for Uniswap V3 pools, swaps, fees, and liquidity
- Top 20 pools by volume (last 30 days) + fee tier breakdown
- Public dashboard → https://dune.com/YOUR_DUNE_USERNAME/uniswap-v3-volume-fees  


### 2. Aave V3 Liquidation Monitor (Python + Web3.py + PostgreSQL)
- Pulls real-time borrows, health factors, and liquidations from Aave V3 Ethereum
- Stores data in local PostgreSQL with proper schema + indexes
- Simple alert when health factor < 1.1
- Folder: `./aave-liquidation-monitor`

### 3. ERC-20 Token Transfer Subgraph (The Graph – Hosted Service)
- Indexed USDT & USDC transfers on Ethereum Mainnet
- GraphQL API ready + example queries
- Deployed subgraph → https://thegraph.com/hosted-service/subgraph/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/usdt-usdc-transfers

### 4. dbt Models on Flipside Crypto Data (Bitcoin + Ethereum)
- Transform raw Flipside tables into clean fact/dimension models
- Includes daily active addresses, transaction fees, and whale movements
- Folder: `./dbt-flipside-bitcoin-ethereum`

## Tech Stack Used
- Dune Analytics (SQL)
- The Graph / Subgraphs
- Web3.py + ethers.py
- PostgreSQL + pgAdmin
- dbt Core
- Python (pandas, requests, sqlalchemy)
- Covalent / Flipside APIs

## Why This Portfolio Works
Traditional ETL engineers who can reliably pull, clean, and model on-chain data are extremely rare in Web3. These projects prove I can do exactly that — with code you can run today.

Available for remote Web3 / Blockchain Data Engineer, Analytics Engineer, or Backend (data-heavy) roles immediately.
